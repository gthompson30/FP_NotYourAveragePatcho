## Project Description
We created a version of the classic game Minesweeper in the terminal. It uses ANSI escape codes to do the coloring, and uses the flood fill algorithm to clear open spaces.

## How-to-run
From the root directory, run:
`javac *java`
This will compile all required files. Then, to run, type:
`java Woo`
